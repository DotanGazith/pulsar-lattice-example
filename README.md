# pulsar-lattice-example

This repository contains an example of recovering the periodicity of PSR J0318+0253 (4FGL J0318.2+0254) using the lattice periodicity search approach described in (**paper**).

The Data was reduced from the Fermi-LAT database using fermitools, and some dedicated auxiliary functions.

Use the requirements file to set up the Python environment, although to install *g6k*, you might want to consult its respective repository (**link**).
